      <p>When we first  bought Taleisin we considered getting an  outboard mounted on the
transom. We even got  a boat builder out in the first couple  of weeks of having
her in  the marina. If  you’re familiar with Taleisin  you’ll know that  she was
built and designed to hate motors. Nothing  is easy with Taleisin, simple is not
easy. Luckily I love a good challenge!</p>

<p>After many talks with a lot of different people I finally came to the conclusion
that I’m not likely to get a motor mounted on Taleisin. If you’ve been following
this blog you’ll be aware of my defeat  in the marina with Ducky on the quarter.
Not  my finest  moment, but  I’m  sure it  was  entertaining to  many. I’ve  had
suggestions of  putting a  well in the  lazaret (with a  plywood box),  I’ve had
suggestions  of sacrificing  the sits  tub for  an inboard  engine. I’ve  always
listened and considered things,  but honestly when people tell me  to put a hole
in Taleisin they normally  lose me. The day will come when I  finally put a hole
in her somewhere, but not yet.</p>

<p>I’ve spent many  hours researching motors, electric and  conventional. I’ve made
new friends on  the internet while doing  this. I looked at  inboard options and
outboard options. I  looked at electric pod motors, electric  trolling motors. I
did thought experiments with these different types of motors. I calculated costs
vs benefits. Weight, practicality and anything  else I could think of. I thought
about different ways to mount the motor, using existing chainplates and rigging,
mounting it on  the rudder, hanging it  from the bumpkin on  a cantilever. Where
would holes  need to be  made in order  to make it  viable. I considered  a side
mounted motor, but rejected that idea because when I had Ducky on the quarter it
was very hard to get steerage as low speed.</p>

<p>Always at some  point I’d stop and  ask myself, what’s the objective?  What am I
trying to  achieve with all of  this. The answer  is never, to give  Taleisin an
engine. The  answer is always to  facilitate learning and accelerate  our way up
the learning  cliff (that’s when the  curve goes up and  backwards). Taleisin is
not a beginners  boat, that means we  can’t take the usual  approach to learning
with her.</p>

<p>When  I got  completely and  utterly defeated  by Taleisin  in the  marina Annie
suggested that we get a mooring and try that approach first (I actually listened
that  time). It  worked and  we learnt  quite a  bit while  on the  mooring. The
reality though, we didn’t get out on Taleisin as much as we should have. Getting
to and from  the mooring was a  long and slow process. Keeping  the objective in
mind, this  was the  opposite. I’d be  lying if  I said that  I didn’t  drive by
Taleisin every time the weather was acting up, to check on her. I probably would
not be  able to do much  in the event that  something went wrong, but  I checked
none the less. Every storm I’d be  laying awake at night worrying about Taleisin
on the mooring (for the record, worrying does nothing but make you feel bad).</p>

<p>With the seasons  changing, I said to  Annie we’re going back in  the marina for
winter. This  wasn’t a hard sell  as Annie must  have been concerned too.  So we
waited for a nice day to move Taleisin back into the marina. This of course left
us stuck in the marina again. I started on solving the motor challenge again. If
it’s easy  to come and go  from the marina, we’ll  use Taleisin a lot  more, and
we’ll learn faster!</p>

<p>About the  same time Lin sent  me an email  saying that there’s some  people she
thinks we’d enjoy meeting, they live on their wooden boat around the corner from
Taleisin. I called Doug and went to his  boat Karie L. We hit it off immediately
and it  wasn’t long before I  started talking about  my idea for a  motor mount.
Doug was kind enough to help me with it.</p>

<p>Doug produced a  lot of conceptual drawings which eventually  lead to the design
that’s now mounted on Taleisin’s bumpkin.

<p>Doug made a pattern for the design and  we got it cast in bronze, I’m very happy
with the results!</p>

<p>The essence  of the mount  is a  length of teak  across the bumpkin,  behind the
rudder. This  is clamped onto  the bumpkin with 2  wooden blocks made  from teak
with bronze bolts through it on either side of the spruce timber of the bumpkin.
We’ve put  some rubber  padding between  the timbers to  protect it.  The bronze
casting slides over the timbers on the port side (in theory this is a reversible
bracket). Timber pads are glued on with sikaflex on the mounting plate, a couple
of rivets are also in place as a “just in case”.</p>

<p>We bought a 20HP Honda outboard. The motor has a 20” shaft, the dealer was great
and installed  a 5” spacer to  make this a 25”  shaft motor, none of  this works
without a 25” shaft motor!</p>

<p>With a  bit of fun  and games we  eventually managed to  get the motor  onto the
bracket. The Leopard Seal in the marina came to investigate while we were at it,
it was likely the banging noise from riveting.</p>

<p>We started the motor up and had it  running in forward and reverse. I had always
known that there would be flex in  the mount if it’s not braced. Doug’s original
concept had a tie-rod  from the chain plate to the mounting  plate. It was clear
that this would be required.</p>

<p>At this point  rather than jumping in  and getting a tie-rod in  place I thought
I’d take  a step back and  play around with a  few different ideas first.  In my
original  idea there  was a  brace that  pushed up  against the  transom and  it
lashings to the  chain plate and taffrail.  While thinking about all  of this it
dawned on  me that  I didn’t  take shock loading  into consideration.  The motor
weighs 52kg.  Shock loading could  turn that  into 500kg static  load equivalent
without too  much effort (think gravity  when bouncing up and  down over waves).
Taking a wave against  the motor is another thing all together  - I haven’t even
started to think  about mitigating that scenario, other than  don’t get into the
situation in the first place.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/28115686394/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1836"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8493/28115686394_562117be84_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1836" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/28115683694/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1839"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8353/28115683694_5b5a9ebde2_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1839" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So my  thinking cap  went on again.  I decided  to get some  cheap timber  for a
prototype from the off-cuts bin at the local hardware store. I knocked something
up that’s  functional. I bolted it  on with 2 eye  bolts. I got some  Dyneema to
create rigging of some  sorts to keep the brace up against  the transom while in
forward and reverse. I added a couple  of turn buckles so I could tighten things
up. I  used a sewn webbing  sling with a larks  foot on the taffrail.  I added a
shackle between the sling and the Dyneema to avoid friction melting through both
(it’s very  scary how  easy this  is to do,  it’s something  I learnt  from rock
climbing). The shackle is tri-loaded which is not ideal, but I doubt it would be
the first point  of failure. One lashing is  around the brace to lift  it up and
wedge it in place  against the transom. The other is to  the eyebolt which takes
some of the motor load. This configuration gives me the triangle structure I was
after to create a strong support.</p>

<p>This rig serves 2  purposes. The first is that it stops  the mount flexing under
the motor’s torque.  The second is that  it transfers some of the  load from the
bumpkin to the taffrail for shock loading.</p>

<p>With all  of this  in place,  Paul, another  friend I  made because  of Taleisin
walked by on  Friday afternoon just as  I was finishing everything up.  He had a
quick look and thought it looked good. The  next thing he asked if I was keen to
give it a go.</p>

<p>So we  prepped Taleisin for her  maiden voyage under  her own motor. We  came up
with a plan  and started to back  out. The sub-title of this  blog is “Adventure
Machine”, and this post would not be complete without some adventure…</p>

<p>We let the  mooring lines go and  start backing Taleisin out. Paul  asked if the
bowsprit was clear from  the pilings as we’re about to turn  into the fairway. I
said the bowsprit  was clear. Paul asked if  we were good to go,  and suddenly I
noticed that  the floating  line between  the bow and  stern mooring  lines were
caught on the lifelines. I ran to release it. It wasn’t possible as I had undone
the lifelines to get the motor on board and had tangled the floating line in the
process. This meant that we’re still attached to the dock.</p>

<p>Quick, put her in forward, I yelled. We got Taleisin stopped so I could undo the
lifelines. Paul was up at the bow fending so that the wind wouldn’t blow us into
the launch next  to us. I got  the lifelines undone and released  us without too
much trouble. Disaster averted!</p>

<p>Back to getting Taleisin out. We backed out and were able to use the outboard as
a bit  of a  stern thruster by  turning it  with it’s tiller.  At this  point it
started to feel like cheating. It was actually easy moving Taleisin. We left the
fairway without any issue. The motor was  not pushing Taleisin’s bow off like we
experienced with ducky on the quarter. It was actually easy to move her!</p>

<p>We took Taleisin  out into the harbour  with her new motor, pushing  against a 2
knot current we were  making 4 knots over the ground.  Everything seemed to work
as  expected. It’s  worth noting  that Paul  had a  blast, we  both enjoyed  the
experience! Paul mentioned that we were busy making history.</p>

<p>Coming  back into  the  berth was  not terribly  difficult  either, compared  to
previous experiences!</p>

<p>It’s a little premature  to call it a complete success. I still  need to see how
things behave  when under sail.  The interesting thing  I noticed is  that while
pushing along under  motor the bit of  timber used to brace  against the transom
actually  gets submerged  at times.  If the  motor did  not have  a 25”  shaft I
suspect it  would be  in danger  of drowning.  While I  don’t expect  any issues
there’s a chance that things might get interesting on a starboard tack. The only
way to find this out is to give it  a try. Given that the stern doesn’t go under
water when sailing  normally there’s no real  reason to believe the  motor is in
danger.</p>

<p>We’ll be  running with the motor  as is for the  time being so I  can figure out
what the next best  step would be. I’m currently thinking  that a tie-rod system
of some sort  would be a good  way to go. It’s  been pointed out to  me that the
taffrail might not be  as strong as it looks. For this I  might figure out a way
to get a block underneath it between the deck and the taffrail to strengthen it.
The other option I  am thinking about with regard to  strenthening the whole lot
is to replace the wire rigging underneath the bumpkin with a couple of tie-rods.
I wont  be making any decisions  in a hurry and  will test the system  in gentle
conditions first.</p>

<p>The next problem I’ll  be trying to solve, is a method for  lifting the motor on
board so  I can store  is down below  in the lazaret. If  I can devise  a simple
system for this it  would become possible to bring the motor  up on deck without
much drama  and most  of these  concerns might  go away.  Provided of  course it
becomes easy to do under way - which is probably far from trivial.</p>

<p>What I like about this approach is that  I’ve not altered Taleisin, so if I want
to change anything I  can without consequences. I can fine  tune and evolve this
into more if I want  to or we can use it to learn  enough to become confident in
moving Taleisin the way she was intended  to be moved. We have more options with
this solution than  the alternatives, it’s not possible to  “unmake” holes. It’s
far from a perfect  solution, but it’s very pragmatic. It  looks like it belongs
on the boat too, which is a nice bonus.</p>

<p>A big  thank you  to everybody  who has  had any  discussions with  me regarding
motors and mounting them. It all added up and this is the sum total of all those
conversations, even  if you  suggested putting  a hole  in the  boat it  was all
valuable. We certainly would not have gotten  this far without all the input and
ideas from everybody.</p>

<p>If anybody reading this  sees a major flaw in my thinking,  please point it out!
If  you have  any  clever idea,  I’d  love to  hear  them! If  and  when I  make
significant changes I’ll do a follow up blog post if there’s any interest in it.</p>
