      <p>A lot has happened since I’ve last written anything. This doesn’t mean that it’s
been boring…</p>

<p>On the contrary, I’m not sure what  to write about since there’s so many awesome
adventures that we’ve had. The only logical  thing to do would be to write about
them in  the order they happened.  Given that watches and  calendars get ignored
aboard, we’ll just say that the following happened some time in February.</p>

<p>We packed up the  possessions we wanted to keep and stored  them safely. We sold
everything worth selling and gave away  anything that we couldn’t sell. The rest
was sent off to the land fill. With the commitment made to live aboard full time
we got stuck  in the marina with some  bad weather. We had a date  to keep since
the CANANZ group were having a dinner  in Warkwarth and they were all planning a
cruise up the Mahurangi river.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/32739029450/in/dateposted-public/" title="Annie Hill&#x27;s fantail. We met Bryan and Linda (the current owners) this weekend we enjoyed a nice visit and beer with the aboard taleisin this afternoon."><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2883/32739029450_1bfefb79c9_c.jpg" width="534" height="800" alt="Annie Hill&#x27;s fantail. We met Bryan and Linda (the current owners) this weekend we enjoyed a nice visit and beer with the aboard taleisin this afternoon." /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We provisioned  Taleisin and played the  waiting game with the  weather and wind
gods. When ever  you’re supposed to be  somewhere at a certain time  and date it
seems impossible to get  good weather for it. Looking at the  light winds in the
forecast, we decided to leave a day earlier than required and hopefully make the
trip over two days instead of one.</p>

<p>We finally had a bit of wind so we cast the dock lines off and set sail! It took
us all  afternoon to make it  as far as Browns  Bay, about half way.  We dropped
anchor and were delighted  to see the movie E.T. screening  on the beach. People
were out having a great time and it was just a perfect way to enjoy the sunset.</p>

<p>It would appear that I’m starting to make a habit of going green the first night
at anchor. I suspect it has something to do with the boat moving differently and
me messing about with Kerosene for the  anchor light. Annie’s always a champ and
takes care of  the things I’m unable to  take care of. Needless to say  I was in
bed early that night so I could regain my composure for the sail in the morning.</p>

<p>We got up with the sun the next morning,  this seems to be the way you live when
you’re on a boat.  Unless we had a late night we’ll wake  up when the sun rises.
We had a quick breakfast and set sail for the Mahurangi river. It was incredibly
light so we  had to use the motor  to push us along a little  while we collected
every bit of puff we could with the sails.</p>

<p>We had to sail  like this for most of the way. We  could see a squall travelling
across the  land and the  sky getting darker. Eventually  we decided to  get our
foul weather  gear out since it  became quite clear  that we where going  to get
wet. The  weather was nice  all day but  the wind was  not. Now the  weather was
turning bad and the wind was good. We finally had enough wind to get some decent
sailing done. It was great we sailed most  of the way up the river and only used
the motor for the final stretch as we  didn’t want to muck around in the shallow
water and potentially run aground.</p>

<p>We made it to our destination with a bit  of time to spare so we kicked back and
relaxed waiting for the other boats to show up.</p>

<p>Not having made the  trip up river on the tide before we  didn’t quite know what
to expect.  I thought we might  be OK to float  on up under oar  power alone. It
wasn’t until those  who knew better told us  that we’d take all night  if we did
that. So  we dug  the little outboard  out of  the lazaret and  tried to  get it
running. After a little messing around we got it started.</p>

<p>We  got ourselves  ready for  a night  out and  started to  motor towards  Close
Encounters, owned by  Stephen, who’s also become a great  friend. About half way
there we realised  that we forgot a  flash light and turned  back. Eventually we
got the  flash light and  attempted to  leave again. This  time we got  half way
there and the engine  died. Out of petrol. Luckily I brought  a little spare can
of petrol with us for just such a  problem. Another couple asked us if we’d like
them to tow us since we appeared broken down. We suggested that they hang around
to see if we could get going again before we turned their offer down.</p>

<p>After filling  the motor up  we were  under way again.  We stopped off  at Close
Encounters for a  quick visit and then we  all set off in our  dinghies for what
turned out  to be  a 5 nautical  mile ride. I’m  sure I’d  still be rowing  if I
didn’t use the motor that night! It was a long dinghy ride, but it was fun doing
it in with  others. We stopped off at  a boat yard and an old  cement factory on
the way. We did a little exploration and stretched our legs before we took to
the water again.</p>

<p>Eventually we all made it safely into  Warkwarth and tied our dinghies up to the
dock in the middle of town. We had a short walk to the pub for dinner.</p>

<p>At dinner we sat next to another couple  that was out cruising as well and had a
great time talking  to them, their boat  is called Fantail. This  named ringed a
bell,  but I  couldn’t  put my  finger  on it.  Fantail is  a  little junk  rig,
naturally I asked if  they were fans of Annie Hill? Their  response was, well we
bought her boat!  No wonder the name Fantail sounded  familiar, I recall reading
somewhere that Annie was sailing a little boat called Fantail.</p>

<p>We suggested that they come and find us  the next day if they were curious about
Taleisin.  Needless to  say we  exchanged stories  and experiences  about owning
famous boats.</p>

<p>The end of the night had arrived, we paid  our bills and then it was time to set
off on the  river in the pitch black night.  I do not recall a moon  at all that
night.  The stars  were  spectacular though.  At this  point  I should  probably
mention that I’m night  blind so doing things in the dark  is always a challenge
for me.</p>

<p>We all hopped in  our dinghies, armed with flash lights and  a leader who’s done
this  before. The  couple leading  the  way was  fantastic, they  found all  the
channel markers and pointed them out to  us while they were happily making their
way down the river.  This is quite an experience, let me try  to paint a picture
for you. Three dinghies,  one had 5 people in it. We all  had flash lights, some
brighter  than others  - I  love my  1000 lumen  flash light.  The lights  would
flicker on  and off, zooming  around like  search lights, picking  up reflective
markers and  then it  would go dark  again. We’d be  winding through  the river,
trying not to run aground or get stuck in the mangroves. Motors would be whining
so we  couldn’t even hear the  other boats. It’s  pitch black, no moon,  but the
stars were bright!  If you’re not careful  your motor would kick up  some mud or
worse stall because you hit the bottom. It’s hard to stay right in the middle of
the river since you I couldn’t see anything without the flash light. It was just
black.</p>

<p>The entire trip went something like this, for us. Annie was laying down with her
head at the bow, face up. This allowed  me to look over her and also keep cheeky
better balanced.  I’m a bit  heavier than  I’m supposed to  be so it  shifts the
balance quite a bit  with the motor on the back. I’d triple  click the button on
my flash light to get it into  turbo mode. So naturally this would progressively
blind Annie as each successive click is brighter than the last (I’ve changed the
setting since  then). Once the  light is  on turbo mode  I can spot  the channel
markers and point cheeky between them. I’d  steer this course for a bit and then
I’d repeat the previous process. I found  it challenging keeping on course as it
was pitch black. Slowly I’d recognise the  land marks as we pass them in reverse
order and mentally try to calculate how far we have left to go.</p>

<p>We were about half way along and  Annie realised that Close Encounters’ crew was
not progressing  down the  river. We turned  back to see  if everything  was OK.
Luckily they  just ran out  of petrol  and was busy  refuelling. It was  at this
point that it dawned on me that I never set Taleisin’s anchor light, finding her
might be a problem.  I asked Stephen if he knew where his  boat was anchored and
from there we’ll  be able to find Taleisin.  We anchored quite a bit  away as we
wanted to  be out of  the current  for the night.  We followed Stephen  to Close
Encounters and  could see our convoy  leader off into the  distance, lighting up
their flash light.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw a whole row of vertical reflectors lighting up in the distance. I
knew exactly  what they were!  Lin and  Larray taped reflectors  onto Taleisin’s
spinnaker pole. I could reach this with my bright little flash light and find my
way home! Not long after that we tied up to Taleisin and was relieved to make it
all the way back. It was a fun and challenging adventure.</p>

<p>The next  morning Chris  from Southern venture  rowed over an  invited us  for a
morning tea and a  catch up. We had a most enjoyable time  getting to know Chris
and Liz. After sharing many stories and adventures we rowed back to Taleisin. By
this time we felt the need to have a nap. We were obviously staying on for a few
more days, it was a Sunday if I  recall correctly which meant that all the other
boats had to get back since they had work the next morning. We would be lying if
we said we felt guilty watching the other boats sail off to return to work.</p>

<p>Our nap got interrupted  when Bryan and Linda from Fantail  hailed us from their
dinghy.  It was  quite  obvious to  them  that they  woke us  up  and were  very
apologetic. Honestly we didn’t mind as we  were just being lazy. We invited them
aboard  and showed  them  around  Taleisin. We  spent  the afternoon  exchanging
experiences on owning famous boats. Bryan is very knowledgable and I spent quite
a bit of time  picking his mind. Linda asked us a question  which we were unable
to answer.  The question was  what’s our favourite  and least favourite  part of
Taleisin? The reason for  this is that every time we find  something we think we
dislike, it’s usually due to us  not understanding the thinking and given enough
time we usually  figure out why it was  done the way it was. There’s  so much to
love about  Taleisin that it’s  hard picking a  favourite, the whole  package is
something special. This is a case of the sum is greater than the parts.</p>

<p>We spent  a few more days  being lazy up the  river before we decided  to weight
anchor and continue our adventure.</p>
