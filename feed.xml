    &lt;p&gt;We woke up in the morning, I said to Annie “if we’re going to move Taleisin today, we better get going. Not much wind but it will pick up later today”. You might wonder, move Taleisin where? Taleisin has been sitting snugly in the marina all winter, as you might imagine getting an 8 ton engineless boat out of a marina can be a little challenging. We have recently had a new mooring laid in a spot that’s easy to sail on and off. This is where Taleisin is moving to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had some previous attempts at getting out of the marina, one didn’t go to well and the other turned into a warping practice run. I might write about the first attempt one day but the bruises are still visible on my ego. In short, I ended up in the water and I drowned an outboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in preparation for our adventure, we prepared Taleisin for sailing, talked through our plan, had a disagreement, came to an agreement and we were finally ready to give it a “go”. We did all of this in just 2 hours. Given previous experience I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t nervous, but I had to hide this from Annie as it would make her more nervous, she was already not that confident in my ability to pull this little stunt off. Not being one to shy away from a challenge, I just dragged my feet for a little bit building up the courage to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have asked me in the past how we deal with the lack of an engine, here’s the current way of doing things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Warp out of the berth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strap the dingy to the quarter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;barge out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/warp1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Getting ready to warp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the warp lines around the pilings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/warp2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Getting ready to warp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled her out slowly using the mooring lines (not in the diagram).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/warp3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Getting ready to warp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annie was in the cockpit pulling on the stern line to turn the boat. I was on the bow pulling the boat closer to avoid the bow sprit hitting the pilings. This was something that happened the first time we tried to warp out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/warp4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Getting ready to warp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the direction the boat is pointing in is the direction of the channel. We tied the dingy to the hip and barged out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s worth noting a few things that we learned from this. Firstly we warped her out really well, it felt great! However, do not put the dingy on the opposite side of the pilings. While there’s no way on, the dingy will push the boat into the pilings (there was no wind to push us off the pilings). Consequently we had a lot of fending to do, this is hard work if you’re moving a heavy boat. Once you have way on (and Taleisin doesn’t need much), it’s very easy to move the boat in this manner! The original plan was to push off the pilings and drift into the middle of the channel, unfortunately this didn’t work out. Next time I’d get the dingy between the boat the and pilings (still need to figure out how we’d go about this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few gut busting seconds later Taleisin was moving fast enough for the rudder to be effective! I looked at Annie raised a fist in the air and said, the hard part is over! Annie obviously didn’t share my victory as we still had to navigate our way out of the marina and into the harbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally making it out of the marina, Annie commented how she’s very glad to be out of the marina as it’s been nothing but unpleasant boating experience inside it. I can completely understand her point of view as it’s been super challenging and we kept getting beaten down by Taleisin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next challenge was to hoist the sails, luckily we picked a day with very little wind. Annie went forward and hoisted the main, it didn’t seem to move us… The next minute a powerboat came speeding by at what was definitely in excess of 12 knots (harbour limits). The wake nearly tipped the dingy and almost drowned the outboard. I leapt over the life lines and onto the dingy to keep it upright. We traveled under motor a little bit longer but the power boats were traveling way too fast and it felt like we were inside a washing machine. I cut the outboard and let the dingy trail behind. I hoisted the staysail and went to sit in the cockpit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ghetto sounder/chart plotter indicated that we were traveling at 1-2 knots. Since it didn’t really feel like we had much in the way of steerage I can only assume that the current was pushing us along. It was interesting to see how quickly Annie’s dislike for power boats grew as we were drifting, she’s a proper sailor now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After drifting for a while and getting thrown around by power boat wakes for too long Annie persuaded me to put the dingy back on the quarter and push Taleisin towards the mooring. Once I got the dingy pushing along we actually saw 5 knots on the Dragonfly pro, I’m guessing at least 1-2 of those were current related. It’s worth noting that the outboard was only at half throttle and only 8HP. Now that we were moving we were making great progress, I also didn’t have to sit in the dingy the whole way and could just steer with the rudder on Taleisin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaching the mooring I hopped into the dingy and slowed the engine down, when we got close enough I just let the engine idle and we kept moving slowly towards the buoy. Pickup was a breeze. There was only one problem, this was not our mooring. Since it’s a new mooring and we’ve never used it we didn’t know what to look for. But the mooring number was not the number I was given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So rather than panic I got the engine pushing along slowly again and Annie steered us towards another buoy. We followed the same recipe as before and pickup was very easy again! We secured Taleisin to the mooring and had a high five moment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re reading along and thinking that’s the end of the adventure you would be forgiven since for most it probably would be. We’re not most and this is when we got seasick for no apparent reason. Taleisin was rolling quite a bit, we still can’t figure out why. I was telling myself to just push through and get everything stashed away and tidied up. Annie lay down on the foredeck and it looked like a good idea to me. We spent about an hour just laying there feeling pretty horrible. I’d get up from time to time trying to keep on working but I didn’t have much luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Annie felt well enough to get back to work, when I got up to try and help I got instructed to lay back down as I was apparently not looking the best. Annie soldiered on like a champ and put Taleisin in order!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had one task that we needed to do before we could head for the dock, get cheeky&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; off her chocks. I had a few attempts at this and eventually managed to get the job done without going green completely! Once this task was done we loaded up the dingy with everything we needed to take back with us, then we learnt something interesting….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we got on the dingy the seasickness was gone. Since the motion of the dingy was different to the motion of Taleisin we felt better, next time I’m getting in the dingy! Motoring back to the dock we were towing Cheeky&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, eventually getting back to the dock the packing up and loading the car up took a while. Approximately 8 hours after we started we finished by stopping for lunch on the way back to the marina to collect our mooring lines and other car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/22393527820/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;DSC_5316&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/571/22393527820_60f6855283_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;681&quot; alt=&quot;DSC_5316&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something as simple as moving from the marina to a mooring turned into an adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting here after having written this whole post and the previous sentence I’m reminded of something that Lin told us before we bought Taleisin: “This is not a boat, it’s an adventure machine”. Lin was right, Taleisin definitely is an adventure machine, even mundane tasks become adventures!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Learning to sail a boat like Taleisin is challenging at best, learning to sail on a boat like Taleisin takes things up a notch! Training wheels! That’s what we need! While Taleisin has got a perfectly good lead line on board (still functioning as well as the day the Pardeys installed it), we’ve got plenty to get right without the worry about how deep the water is. Enter the Raymarine Dragonfly 4 Pro, now don’t get me wrong, there’s no substitute for common sense and we fully intend on moving to old school navigation and old school depth sounding. Baby steps are normally the way to start, jumping in the deep end with a boat like Taleisin provides plenty of challenge without the added bits around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after spending some time searching around and scratching my head I came up with this little design. It’s a 25mm PVC pipe with a 20mm dowel shoved down the inside. It’s a prototype, the idea is that the dowel prevents the flex, and PVC is pretty well suited to being in water. I still need to seal the bottom of it using some silicon or epoxy or what ever will do the job. It should be quite obvious to the observer that we don’t intend on putting a through hull transducer on Taleisin and that this is just a “portable” sounder and chart plotter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/22243349589/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;IMG_1337&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/663/22243349589_36106320d1_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_1337&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lashing the pipe to the transom as a temporary measure, I will do this slightly better before I take it out for a test sail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/22404136546/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;IMG_1338&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5703/22404136546_d38cf9aa86_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_1338&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fashioned some form of plug and play system using an existing 12V plug in Taleisin. We’re not very keen on altering Taleisin without having thought it through properly. This allows me to play and if I choose to throw it out, nobody will know any better (well maybe they will if they read this post). I guess I’m trying to say that the boat will not be harmed with this little experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/22242426758/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;IMG_1341&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5785/22242426758_6bab8d10a8_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_1341&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added little bonus, it’s got a GPS chart plotter for added entertainment. This will provide a makeshift set of instrumentation for speed, depth and GPS. While I could have used an iPad - and I thought about it, using some wifi type transducer with the Navionics app. This would have left me with the small issue that it’s not waterproof. After doing a lot of reading I ended up going with the dragonfly instead, added bonus is that I can connect the iPad via wifi and still have a larger screen. I also think I might get better battery life out of the dragonfly than the iPad, but time will tell!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/22404132386/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;IMG_1339&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5650/22404132386_e7530ce891_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_1339&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will all of this work out? I have no idea, but if it works it will allow some training wheels during the early stages. Once we get up to standard with our skills it wont matter any more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This story begins early the previous morning. We had to drive 1 hour to Sandspit to catch the ferry which would drop us off on the Pardey’s jetty. Once we got there we rowed out to Taleisin like we have done a few times in the past. We loaded our personal belongings onto Taleisin, only what we needed to survive for the next 2 days. This meant we had some food and warm clothes should the weather require it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After loading our personal belongings on the boat we spent some time with Lin in the boat workshop. She spent quite a while explaining what all the bits and pieces are that we should be loading onto Taleisin. There was a big pile of it, I remember asking Lin where it would all fit. Lin assured me that it’s all been on Taleisin and that she will swallow it without any issues. After going through everything in detail we began the long day of ferrying everything to Taleisin via Cheeky&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. I had a discussion with Lin about the weather forecast as some heavy weather was forecast for the afternoon. We decided that we’ll set sail early in the morning and we should hopefully beat the bad weather, it’s only about 30 nautical miles to sail. Loading Taleisin took a very long and time we were absolutely exhausted as we finished the last load in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got up as early as we could manage, had a quick breakfast and started to prepare Taleisin to set sail. I rigged up a GoPro and set it to record while this was going on. Underestimating the battery life on the GoPro it ran out of power long before things got exciting. Below is an edit of some of the footage, there’s not much going on but it will give you an idea of what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yCuMyVlxJ3A&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something to keep in mind, Annie and I have never sailed a big boat on our own. We’ve had some sailing lessons, been on a couple of sailing trips with people who are experienced. That was about the extent of our sailing experience on big boats. I’m very fortunate that my day job requires me to learn things very quickly, retain them, and put them to use almost immediately. This skill came in very handy when it was time to sail Taleisin out of the cove. Taleisin does not have an engine, this means there’s a bonus challenge when it comes to sailing, everything must be done under sail or via sculling oar. Given that at this point I’ve never sculled a boat in my life, we’re sailing off the mooring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very calm in the morning and hardly any wind in the cove. Once we prepared Taleisin, I asked Annie if she’d prefer to be on the helm or drop the mooring line. She opted to drop the mooring line as it was less responsibility and something she felt was easier to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stored cheeky&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on deck, hoisted the sails, tucked a reef in the main and Annie went forward to drop the mooring line. I pulled the sheets in, pulled the tiller over, took a deep breath… thinking “here we go”! The sails filled gently Taleisin picked up enough way and we started moving. I recall Annie asking, so when do we start sailing? My response was, we’re sailing now, it’s just very slow, but we’re sailing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We slowly weaved our way through all the moored boats and eventually made it out of the cove. We decided the previous night that we’d sail through the inner channel as it seemed like it might be more sheltered in case the weather pick up as there was a few islands that might provide some protection from the rougher seas. We had a glorious morning of easy sailing, the winds were light the water was smooth. I remember thinking, this is what life should be all about! Sailing is slow going, it’s great if you don’t have to be anywhere in a hurry! We removed the reef from the main and hoisted the big jib instead of the staysail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we sailed past Motuora Island things started to get a bit more exciting. The wind has slowly increased and we haven’t noticed as we’ve been running with it the whole way. The waves started to build. We don’t agree on the exact hight of the waves, but they were sufficiently big enough to cause Annie to get seasick. The swell was beam on, at no point did we feel in danger so we didn’t change course. Taleisin was just taking this all in her stride. Annie spent some time hanging over the lee rail. She eventually recovered and we sailed on towards the Whagaparoa passage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point We changed course towards long bay, the swell was now pushing us along and Taleisin was surfing the waves - this is a LOT of fun. Taleisin was very stable during this whole experience! After doing a bit of fun sailing we realised that we should probably sail around Devenport. I went down below to grab the ipad to verify our position and check out the charts on it. Due to the sea state I rushed back up on deck and I turned green very quickly. Now it was my turn to hang over the lee rail for over an hour. Annie did a fantastic job at the helm while I recovered. At this point we’re sailing towards Rangitoto Island with the intention of jibing once we pass Devenport. It will be an easy run into the marina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got to Devenport I said to Annie, lets Jibe! So we went through the procedure, started to jibe… That’s when I realised that the wind was blowing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; stronger than we realised. All of a sudden the heel was far more than we were comfortable. I yelled let the sheets go! Annie let the jib sheet go, I let the main sheet go, I pulled the helm hard over, Taleisin came back up right and I pointed her into the wind. I yelled out to Annie, get on the helm, keep her into the wind, I’m changing sails and reefing the main.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went forward, dropped the jib, dropped the main, put a reef in the main, hoisted the main and hoisted the staysail. That felt much better, less sail was a lot more manageable. Later we learned that the wind was 30kts gusting 35kts. I took the tiller, let Taleisin drop off and we started to sail again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here on out the sailing was actually pretty easy going. While about 30 minutes away from the marina I called the marina up asking the push boat to assist us getting into our marina berth. I was advised to radio once we get in and they will come and tie up next to us. When we got to the marina entrance we rounded up into the wind, I dropped the head sail, tucked another reef into the main. This was when I had the most expensive accident for the day, the jib sheet knocked my sun glasses off my head and I watched them sink to the bottom of the harbour - I had a fleeting thought about jumping in after them, but then realised that it was probably a very bad idea. I yelled some expletives (see I’m a real sailor now) and sailed into the marina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we entered the marina I got onto the radio and the marina boat met us about half way down the channel. They tied up next to us and we dropped the main sail. I made the mistake of thinking that the push boat crew would know what they are dealing with. Things got really exciting as they didn’t realise just how heavy Taleisin is. We had a few near misses with other boats, but eventually we got Taleisin all tied up. We sat down for a couple of minutes to regain composure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went down below, I grabbed my phone and gave Lin a call “Your baby is all tied up in Westhaven, all safe and sound”. I recanted some of the adventures and I could sense that she was relieved that we made it without anything major go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learnt more during that one trip than we did during a whole week’s worth of sailing lessons. We had to respond quickly, we had to think on our feet (something I’m fortunately used to due to my day job). More importantly we learnt that if things go wrong get yourself into a position where you can slow down, think, regroup and solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be remiss of me if I didn’t point out that this story mostly reflects the abilities of Taleisin and not that of our own. I’m convinced that if it was a lesser boat, things would not have been so smooth. We are indeed very proud care takers of this well found vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin Pardey wrote her side of the story &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.landlpardey.com/june-2015-newsletter.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
