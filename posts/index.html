write something new.</p>

<p>Right now I’m sitting in the Kawau boating club, waiting for the New Year’s eve
celebrations to start.  I’m looking out over the water  at Taleisin and thinking
back to the year that’s has been.</p>

been boring…</p>

<p>On the contrary, I’m not sure what  to write about since there’s so many awesome
adventures that we’ve had. The only logical  thing to do would be to write about
them in  the order they happened.  Given that watches and  calendars get ignored
aboard, we’ll just say that the following happened some time in February.</p>

<p>We packed up the  possessions we wanted to keep and stored  them safely. We sold
everything worth selling and gave away  anything that we couldn’t sell. The rest
was sent off to the land fill. With the commitment made to live aboard full time
we got stuck  in the marina with some  bad weather. We had a date  to keep since
the CANANZ group were having a dinner  in Warkwarth and they were all planning a
cruise up the Mahurangi river.</p>

land for some time is so that we can avoid being on land for some time.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/32547798620/in/dateposted-public/" title="Life aboard taleisin"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3725/32547798620_bb3a55fdc7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Life aboard taleisin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Let me explain. It’s now been a week and a half since Taleisin has been our only
home.  We  spent the  last  month  sorting through  all  our  stuff and  selling
everything  that is  surplus  to  requirement. The  rest  was  put into  storage
awaiting our  return some day  in the future. We  got the smallest  storage unit
that we  could get away  with and  really only stored  things that we  wanted to
store. This was challenging as it  forced us to go through absolutely everything
we own to ensure we’re not paying to store junk.</p>

    <time datetime="2017-01-18T19:31:07+13:00">January 18, 2017</time>      <p class="article"><p>I’ve been warned about this before,  cruising with a schedule doesn’t work. This
is more  true if you’re  sailing engine  less. While it’s  true that we  have an
outboard, we don’t carry that much petrol and when there’s a reasonable chop the
motor is not much use.</p>

<p>We broke a  cardinal rule of cruising.  Whilst we’re both taking  a timeout from
work  at the  moment,  I’ve been  temporarily  sucked back  into  work for  some
important business deals to get closed out.</p>

<p>This unfortunate or  fortunate, depending on your perspective, fact  has lead to
us sailing back  to the marina in less than  favourable conditions. The schedule
dictated our  sailing day. Weather  plays an important  role in sailing  for us.
Since we’re still  learning we don’t like  to sail in conditions  that is beyond
our ability and comfort levels.</p>

adventures. After  our little adventure  with Taleisin  in Bon Accord  Harbor we
talked about the situation and what could have been done better. Sure, we didn’t
break  anything and  nobody got  injured,  but that  doesn’t mean  that we  were
comfortably in control.</p>

<p>We discussed it with Lin, and she shed some light on what may have happened. Lin
suggested that  we take her little  12.5’ boat out for  a sail and go  and learn
what the winds do when you get closer to the headlands.</p>

<p>While waiting for  a bit more suitable  weather as the wind was  blowing quite a
bit and it was really gusty too! We  just kicked back and relaxed. We did have a
day where we went walking on the other side of North Cove. It truly is a magical
island. It’s  not in any way  related to the  timeline we’re used to.  It really
feels like  time has moved on  and this little island  is stuck in the  past. We
absolutely love this place!</p>

    <time datetime="2017-01-08T18:33:23+13:00">January 08, 2017</time>      <p class="article"><p>With the weather  turning and the anchorage getting less  comfortable we decided
to  find a  better spot.  We spent  the  last few  days carrying  water back  to
Taleisin. We did it the hard way, we  carried 20 Litre water cans back and forth
for a  total of  4 trips. We  rowed back and  forth and  loaded it all  on board
Taleisin. Yes we probably could have motored up to the dock and done it all very
quickly. That all sounded  too easy so we did it the hard  way. We got some good
exercise and I’m sure we’re better off because of it.</p>

<p>We  got Taleisin  ready to  sail  this morning.  We checked  and double  checked
everything. We put  a reef in the  main as it’s blowing around  17 knots gusting
into the  20’s. We  hoisted the main,  but didn’t cleat  the sheet  off. Feeling
confident we started to winch the anchor in, it’s a tough job if you’re not used
to it. I feel  like we’ll be better off physically in the  long run doing things
this way, rather than  the alternative. Time will tell if this gets easier or
more painful…</p>

did  some work  on Taleisin.  Double  checking the  hull is  clean, making  sure
everything is removed behind the rudder. She’s looking pretty sweet! While I was
at it,  I got Lin  to supervise me  replacing the Sikaflex  on a few  small deck
seams. Whilst  it’s not rocket  science, there was a  few things I  didn’t know.
It’s always silly  in my eyes to not  learn from those around you  before you go
experimenting and  trying to work  out how to  do something that’s  already been
done.</p>

and inspect the seacock that’s been giving me grief as of late.</p>

<p>We got  the motor  going and  took Taleisin for  a trip  around the  bay, mostly
because the wind was blowing and we weren’t comfortable taking the direct route.
We navigated our way through all the moored boats and slowly made our way to the
jetty.</p>

of salt will be the job done. Use a bit of elbow grease and it’s not long before
you have something that resembles dough.</p>

happy to see the back of 2016. Happy New Year, may 2017 be a good one.</p>

<p>Last year when we were at the wooden  boat festival we did an interview with Dan
Mattson.  It was  a bit  of fun  and  Dan has  just sent  me the  word that  the
interview is up on his pod cast. If you’re curious have a listen

<p>We’re still hanging out  in North Cove, we got invited to a  small new years eve
gathering with  the locals. We had  a great time and  got to see parts  of North
Cove we’ve never seen before. This place  is magical. When we head over that way
again I’ll  be sure to take  some pictures. Thank  you to all the  residents for
making our time here very pleasurable!</p>

<p>After  a bit  of trial  and error  we figured  out how  to use  the oven  aboard
Taleisin. We did of  course have the benefit of being on a  mooring just a short
row from Lin’s door step. Lin is  always very helpful and knows everything about
anything aboard Taleisin.</p>

<p>We’ve been  having a great time  in North Cove.  Lin invited us over  for dinner
along with the family on the French yacht next to us. Lin served what could only
be described as the best salmon I’ve  ever had. Everything is always lovely when
you’re over  for dinner at  the Pardey’s.  The company is  good and the  food is
always excellent!</p>

bonus we slept in this morning too. It’s  not like we have somewhere to be!? The
plan was to move Taleisin to a mooring closer to Lin’s place.</p>

<p>After we  finally decided to  wake up we  went on deck  and the cove  was nearly
empty. We were trying  to figure out which mooring we were  supposed to pick up.
After a bit of back and forth Annie suggested that we row over and check it out,
even tough it would be a right pain to row back.</p>

<p>While we were busy trying to get Cheeky off the cabin top a friendly sailor came
along side in a kayak and introduced herself.  We invited her on board for a bit
of a chat as it was quite choppy in  the spot we anchored. It turns out that her
boat was on the mooring next to the one  we were moving to. We asked her if she’d
mind helping us move. She was a real sport and jumped to it.</p>

co-operate, instead we motored all day and tucked in for the night.</p>

<p>So, it turns out  that it was quite a bouncy anchorage,  easily corrected with a
snubber off  the bowsprit. Whilst  this didn’t stop the  bounce it made  it more
than habitable.</p>

<p>This morning I said to Annie, “I want to sail off the anchor!”. We had the motor
in neutral, just in  case. I  prepared Taleisin for  sailing while  Annie cooked
breakfast. After we finished eating and  putting Taleisin in order down below we
winched in the anchor until we were just  about ready to lift it. We hoisted the
stays’l. Annie grabbed the tiller and when  the anchor was up she sheeted in the
stays’l. We were off without a hitch! I hoisted the main and the jib while Annie
slowly sailed us out of the anchorage. It was a nice start to the day.</p>

    <time datetime="2016-12-26T17:10:15+13:00">December 26, 2016</time>      <p class="article"><p>This might be  the post most of  the people following this little  blog has been
waiting for. Well maybe, we’re not heading  off shore, but we have cast the dock
lines off  for the  time being.  We’ve got  the boat  provisioned and  we’re out
playing!</p>

<p>This will be a little longer than  the previous weekend cruise we did (I haven’t
written about it yet, but it was  great). We’re currently sitting at anchor in a
small bay called Okoromai (Shakespeare) Bay.  We’re the only boat anchored here,
and there might be a reason for that we’re not sure yet.</p>

<p>Our  plan  was to  sail  to  Kawau  Island today,  but  there  was no  wind,  so
unfortunately we had to use the noisy  outboard motor to get away from the dock.
The bottom line is that we’re out, away from the dock and we’re sailing! Well we
will be! We’ve decided to hang out in this little bay until the wind picks up so
we can continue our little journey to Kawau Island.</p>

<p>There’s not much to  say about the adventure today as  it was rather uneventful.
We managed  to leave the marina  just fine, which of  course is a huge  bonus as
we’ve not had the best of luck with marina adventures to date! We managed to get
a  bit of  sailing done  in  the harbour  but  then the  winds died  completely.
Motoring is not fun  and we didn’t really care for it. It  was really a means to
an end,  now that we’ve left  the doc we don’t  feel the pressure of  needing to
leave. That part is done!</p>

<p>Given that we’ve been  so busy with the run up to Christmas  we’re both tired so
now  it’s time  to rest  and recover  from all  the stress  we’ve placed  on our
bodies.</p>

<p>Below are  some pictures  of the  little anchorage we’re  in. We’re  anchored in
about 4.5 meters of water and so far it would seem like a calm quite anchorage!</p>

interested and exciting  opportunities. We are not only new  to wooden boats but
to boats and sailing itself. One evening after completing one of many boat tasks
I gave  Lin Pardey a call  to share my  experiences. Lin suggested that  we come
along to the  wooden boat festival in Port Townsend  Washington State, USA. This
presented numerous challenges concerning work for  both Annie and myself. When I
got home that evening I told Annie about this random spur of the moment idea and
we decided that life is too short, screw it - lets do it!</p>

    <time datetime="2016-08-08T14:58:17+12:00">August 08, 2016</time>      <p class="article"><p>After some discussions on forums, it became obvious that I’d have to do a follow
up post on why I got a 20 hp. Honda motor.</p>

<p>There was a few variables that went into the equation.</p>

<p>Weight, Cost and Horsepower.</p>

<p>I looked at  the Torqeedo 4 kw motor. That  in theory was a good idea,  8 hp. in
cruise  mode, 10  hp. thrust  (which incidentally  Lin and  Larry said  would be
enough).  This motor  is about  20 kg.  Then comes  the batteries.  The Torqeedo
batteries are 24.3 kg. each, you  require 2. These batteries are very expensive,
so going with a lead-acid/AGM option you’d  need 4 x 200 A/H batteries (Torqeedo
batteries  are 24V  lithium).  Finding  space for  these  batteries  would be  a
challenge in it’s  own right. Not to  mention that the costs would  be very high
for a  setup like  this and  charging would be  a challenge  unless you’re  in a
marina. Even then  it’s very easy to add  petrol to a tank, start  the motor and
go. Not  the same with batteries.  This is also  not a simple setup,  it’s quite
complicated and at odds with the rest  of the boat. Incidentally I looked at the
10 kw motor too, that weighs 64kg and requires twice as many batteries, so twice
the problem.  Not to  mention 3  times the cost  without installation  costs and
brackets etc.</p>

    <time datetime="2016-07-31T10:59:23+12:00">July 31, 2016</time>      <p class="article"><p>When we first  bought Taleisin we considered getting an  outboard mounted on the
transom. We even got  a boat builder out in the first couple  of weeks of having
her in  the marina. If  you’re familiar with Taleisin  you’ll know that  she was
built and designed to hate motors. Nothing  is easy with Taleisin, simple is not
easy. Luckily I love a good challenge!</p>

<p>After many talks with a lot of different people I finally came to the conclusion
that I’m not likely to get a motor mounted on Taleisin. If you’ve been following
this blog you’ll be aware of my defeat  in the marina with Ducky on the quarter.
Not  my finest  moment, but  I’m  sure it  was  entertaining to  many. I’ve  had
suggestions of  putting a  well in the  lazaret (with a  plywood box),  I’ve had
suggestions  of sacrificing  the sits  tub for  an inboard  engine. I’ve  always
listened and considered things,  but honestly when people tell me  to put a hole
in Taleisin they normally  lose me. The day will come when I  finally put a hole
in her somewhere, but not yet.</p>

delivery of her, Annie told me that we’ll have to haul her out and sand her down
properly. As  always I should just  listen to Annie,  but that would be  far too
easy, it’s a much better idea to charge off and learn lessons the hard way…</p>

<p>While talking to my father on the phone I mentioned that I might buy him a plane
ticket from Australia to come and give me a hand - I was only kidding as I would
never put him to  work against his will. A couple of days  later my father calls
me up, asking when  Taleisin is coming out of the water as  he’s coming over and
give me a hand. Great I’ll have extra  hands to do more work. Annie’s father was
due in  New Zealand  shortly after and  he is  always keen to  lend a  hand with
anything  that  resembles  work.  There’s  a  lot  to  be  said  for  the  older
generation’s willingness to work, no matter  how soul destroying or miserable it
might be. So I started to make a list (oh how naive I was in my younger days).</p>

<hr />

<p>As is normal for me, when I get a new  toy I want to use it. At this point we’ve
owned Taleisin  for a few weeks.  I’ve been out on  her once with Chad  from the
CYA. He  showed me how to  barge using Cheeky and  the 2.5hp motor, and  he also
taught  me how  to scull.  Chad  is super  experienced,  I didn’t  do the  whole
procedure myself and I don’t have any “what if” plans.</p>

<p>I came up with a plan, if 2.5hp can do it, I can get an inflatable with a bigger
engine and that should  make things much easier. So I go shopping,  I get a 2.6m
Zodiac and an  8hp outboard. Armed with a  new sure fire way to  get Taleisin in
and out of  the marina I study the  weather forecasts and pick a  day that seems
like it would be perfect.</p>

move  the boat  at a  slow  pace. You  think  to yourself,  “excellent, lets  to
sailing”. Suddenly you realise it’s Tuesday morning and you’re supposed to be at
work for meetings. So you make a decision….</p>

<p>I did attend the required meetings and  told everybody in the office, that’s it,
I’m going sailing  see you tomorrow! I  went home, had a quick  lunch and loaded
Ducky in the car. Annie and I were off to the dock…</p>

<p>I’m very  fortunate that I can  at times have flexibility  around working hours,
most of the time  we’re very busy and I have to keep  my nose to the grindstone.
I’m working towards freeing more time up  for playing. Annie is a school teacher
and she’s fortunately still on holiday.</p>

<p>We’re becoming  more efficient at getting  away from the dock.  We were motoring
towards Taleisin in  Ducky in no time  at all. Once onboard Taleisin  we got her
prepped for  sailing, we looked  at each  other. We each  took a deep  breath. I
hoisted the main sail. We cast off the mooring line. Taleisin fell off the wind.
The main sail filled and we were sailing!</p>

excited about the prospect  of sailing in the dinghy. I  was thinking to myself,
this is huge, Annie is pushing <em>me</em> to  go sailing. So we loaded the car up with
Cheeky’s oars and small 2.5hp outboard.</p>

<p>Getting  cheeky launched  was quick  and easy  and  we were  on our  way out  to
Taleisin in no time. You might be wondering why we’re going to Taleisin if we’re
dinghy sailing!?  The answer is simple,  of course, Cheeky’s mast,  rudder, drop
board, tiller and sail  is onboard Taleisin. Once we got  to Taleisin we grabbed
everything we needed to rig cheeky for sailing  and went back to the dock to rig
her up.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/23792203469/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1474"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1441/23792203469_cc43ed49e2_c.jpg" width="800" height="516" alt="IMG_1474" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From what I’ve read the strength of a spring is determined by:<br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>Wire diameter<br /></li>
  <li>Outer diameter<br /></li>
  <li>Free Length (length of spring)<br /></li>
  <li>Number of total coils<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>Wire diameter: 0.7 mm</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/23531821304/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1478"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1693/23531821304_89d16574b9_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1478" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Outer diameter: 5mm</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/23531821304/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1478"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1693/23531821304_89d16574b9_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1478" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Free length: 39.9mm</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/24160019885/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1476"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1600/24160019885_1f0264c0ce_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1476" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I counted 57 coils, also 39.9 / 0.7 = 57</p>

<p>I also measured the ends: 26.4mm (but this might be a little bit off as I didn’t
remove the screw).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/23864397880/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_1479"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1559/23864397880_8914e58bef_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_1479" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Here’s a calculator that might be of use: <a href="http://www.acxesspring.com/extension-spring-calculator-instructions.html">Calculator - external link</a></p>

<p>Estimate of length inside “hooks” 92.360 mm.</p>

<p>If you need more accuracy, let me know,  and I’ll take screws out and measure it
correctly.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-10-29T20:56:22+13:00">October 29, 2015</time>      <p class="article"><p>We woke  up in the  morning, I said  to Annie “if  we’re going to  move Taleisin
today, we better get going. Not much wind  but it will pick up later today”. You
might  wonder, move  Taleisin where?  Taleisin has  been sitting  snugly in  the
marina all winter, as you might imagine  getting an 8 ton engineless boat out of
a marina can be a little challenging. We have recently had a new mooring laid in
a spot that’s easy to sail on and off. This is where Taleisin is moving to.</p>

<p>We’ve had some previous attempts at getting  out of the marina, one didn’t go to
well and the other  turned into a warping practice run. I  might write about the
first attempt one day  but the bruises are still visible on my  ego. In short, I
ended up in the water and I drowned an outboard.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-10-24T21:52:43+13:00">October 24, 2015</time>      <p class="article"><p>Learning to sail a  boat like Taleisin is challenging at  best, learning to sail
on a boat like Taleisin takes things up a notch! Training wheels! That’s what we
need!  While  Taleisin has  got  a  perfectly good  lead  line  on board  (still
functioning as well  as the day the  Pardeys installed it), we’ve  got plenty to
get right  without the worry  about how deep the  water is. Enter  the Raymarine
Dragonfly 4 Pro, now don’t get me  wrong, there’s no substitute for common sense
and we  fully intend  on moving to  old school navigation  and old  school depth
sounding. Baby steps are normally the way to start, jumping in the deep end with
a boat like Taleisin provides plenty  of challenge without the added bits around
the edges.</p>

<p>So after spending  some time searching around  and scratching my head  I came up
with this little design. It’s a 25mm PVC  pipe with a 20mm dowel shoved down the
inside. It’s a prototype, the idea is  that the dowel prevents the flex, and PVC
is pretty well suited  to being in water. I still need to  seal the bottom of it
using some  silicon or epoxy or  what ever will do  the job. It should  be quite
obvious  to  the  observer that  we  don’t  intend  on  putting a  through  hull
transducer on  Taleisin and  that this  is just a  “portable” sounder  and chart
plotter.</p>

    <time datetime="2015-10-22T22:15:33+13:00">October 22, 2015</time>      <p class="article">This story begins  early the previous morning. We had  to drive 1 hour to Sandspit to  catch the ferry which  would drop us off on  the Pardey's jetty. Once we got there we rowed out to Taleisin  like we have done a few times in the past. We  loaded our personal belongings  onto Taleisin, only what  we needed to survive for the next 2 days. This meant we had some food and warm clothes should the weather require it.</p>
