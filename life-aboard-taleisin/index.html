      <p>It’s been a while since our last water based adventure. The reason we’ve been on

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/32547798620/in/dateposted-public/" title="Life aboard taleisin"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3725/32547798620_bb3a55fdc7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Life aboard taleisin" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Let me explain. It’s now been a week and a half since Taleisin has been our only
home.  We  spent the  last  month  sorting through  all  our  stuff and  selling
everything  that is  surplus  to  requirement. The  rest  was  put into  storage
awaiting our  return some day  in the future. We  got the smallest  storage unit
that we  could get away  with and  really only stored  things that we  wanted to
store. This was challenging as it  forced us to go through absolutely everything
we own to ensure we’re not paying to store junk.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>When we  surrendered the keys to  the rental house we  still had 2 car  loads of
stuff that we had to deal with. It was either coming with us onboard Taleisin or
we would  have to get  rid of it  since our storage unit  was full. I  guess you
could say that we’ve completely de-cluttered and paired down to the essentials.</p>

<p>A few things we’ve learnt in the mean time…</p>

<p>Taleisin is comfortable, and not  just comfortable for cruising, comfortable for
living. I  agree that 30 foot  is a small boat,  but she doesn’t feel  small. We
have had to adjust the way we do things, but it’s not been a huge hassle for us.
We’ve been living  at the dock without electricity, other  than that provided by
our 100  watt solar panel.  Honestly it’s not a  hardship, we love  the kerosene
lamps and  cooking with LPG (aka  propane) is a joy.  The ice box does  it’s job
well enough that we don’t miss the fridge. You can tell that Taleisin’s interior
was designed to be  very liveable, I cannot compare it to  other boats but she’s
perfect.</p>

<p>Keeping a small space tidy is a bit  harder since it doesn’t take much for it to
get completely  out of hand.  Combine this with the  fact that we’re  still busy
loading stuff onto Taleisin and the problem compounds very quickly. We have just
about got  everything onboard now  and things are  starting to look  quite good.
We’re still  a few  days away from  casting off as  we have  a few boat  jobs to
complete before we can go. Then there’s the all important provisioning.</p>

<p>The transition  has been significantly  eased by  spending nights aboard  in the
marina and a 3 week cruise, without this it would have been much harder. We gave
up broadcast  TV almost  2 years  ago, opting  for on  demand streaming  via the
internet.  This actually  lead to  the  act of  TV watching  becoming an  active
engagement rather than it running  continuously and nobody paying attention. The
result was  that we ended up  watching a lot less  TV than we did  before. TV is
actually one of the things we do not miss.</p>

<p>You might  be wondering, so  what do we miss?  Interestingly not much.  While we
have to walk 500 meters to the bathroom block for a shower and to use the toilet
it’s not  a huge burden.  While we could  use the bucket  and wag bag  system on
aboard we feel it’s just a needless waste.</p>

<p>It’s raining  today, the first  day it’s really  raining while living  on board.
This will be a real test to see just how inconvenient it would be to head to the
bathroom block.  We had  to head  out in  the rain  a few  times today  and it’s
starting to wear on Annie a little,  but as with everything I suspect we’ll just
get used to it and life will go on as it always has.</p>

<p>Another  point  of   interest  is  the  psychology  involved   in  pairing  down
possessions, it’s hard!  Do not let anybody tell you  anything different. You’re
forced to confront  your decisions about buying something that  turned out to be
completely useless, cost a lot of money and has absolutely no resale value. This
implies  that  there  would be  a  huge  loss  involved  and that  the  cost  or
reacquisition would be huge as well, but the initial point was that the item was
useless.  I do  not know  why,  but I’ve  had a  lot  of these  items that  I’ve
justified keeping for many  years. I can now say that after letting  go of a few
of these items it becomes easier to let go of the rest. At some point it becomes
harder to  hold onto  things than to  let things  go. Annie has  had to  put the
breaks on me as I’d just continue till there’s nothing left.</p>

<p>Being at the point  we’re currently at, which is on the brink  of cruising I can
understand why most people never even get  this far. It’s hard! Yes it’s easy to
talk about cruising  and dream about cruising,  but it’s not easy to  get to the
actual cruising. While  most people were supportive in theory  and thought it to
be  a great  idea.  In practice  we  found that  nobody really  wants  us to  go
cruising. Both  Annie and  myself found  it incredibly hard  to break  ties with
work. While Annie had  the simple case of just resigning and it  was over for me
it’s not that simple. As a person heavily involved in tech start-ups and being a
key person from everybody’s perspective in  the ventures, it’s hard. I’ve had to
sail back in  unfavourable conditions for meetings to secure  future business at
critical junctures. Now that  I’ve actually put a stake in  the ground and said,
No more!  I could  sense the  disappointment in my  business collogues.  While I
personally do  not believe they will  struggle without me as  I’ve trained those
around me to deal with everything I’ve  been dealing with. I can understand that
they might feel like they are losing a lot.</p>

<p>Family and  friends has been a  lot more supportive than  anticipated. I’ve read
many books stating that family and friends  are not supportive as they will miss
you too  much. We  have, however,  not made  the mistake  of letting  friends or
family believe  that this is  up for negotiation. This  is something both  of us
desperately need. It’s been a lot easier from the friends and family perspective
than expected.  Those friends and family  reading this, thank you  very much for
being supportive and understanding regardless of how you might really feel about
it.  It  has  been  hard  enough  to reach  this  point  without  having  active
discouragement from you guys! We really appreciate it.</p>

<p>Naturally those of you  reading this will want to know what  our next plans are.
Well we have  a few months off, we  might head North, or South  depending on the
wind  direction.  We plan  on  taking  things as  they  come,  we have  no  huge
aspirations to circumnavigate or  to round Cape Horn. Right now  we just want to
learn to sail  Taleisin properly and sail  her well. We need some  time out from
the real world. The plan  is to sail till the end of the  season or until we get
sick of  it, which ever  comes first. If  we manage to  reach that point  we can
decide what’s next at that time!</p>

<p>If you’re  considering cruising and  wondering at this  point if it’s  worth the
trouble. I  can’t speak from  experience, but I  can assure you  that absolutely
every cruiser I’ve spoken to has told me that it was the best decision they have
ever made. Surely if  it’s this hard to get to this point,  it’s got to be worth
the effort.  The other  thing to  keep in  mind is that  if it  was easy  to do,
everybody would  be doing  it. If  everybody was  doing it  we’d be  looking for
something else to do as that would then be the real world…</p>
