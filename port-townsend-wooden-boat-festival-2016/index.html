      <p>Our  recent status  as  wooden boat  owners  has  opened up  many  new doors  to
interested and exciting  opportunities. We are not only new  to wooden boats but
to boats and sailing itself. One evening after completing one of many boat tasks
I gave  Lin Pardey a call  to share my  experiences. Lin suggested that  we come
along to the  wooden boat festival in Port Townsend  Washington State, USA. This

<p>I distinctly remember Annie asking, “What will I be doing for three whole days”?</p>

<p>Fast forward to September 6 2016, we’re on our way to Port Townsend via Seattle.
This is one of  the routes into Port Townsend. In order to  get to Port Townsend
you  really want  to have  to get  there. Driving  from Seattle  takes 2  hours,
getting there by  public transport is quite  a feat in itself.  Our journey from
Seattle started early  in the morning taking  the train from our  hotel close to
the SeaTac  airport. A short walk  from down town  Seattle to a 30  minute ferry
ride. Once off the  Ferry we caught a bus to Poulsbo, then  we spent the bulk of
the day in Poulsbo  waiting for one of 2 buses to Port  Townsend, one at 9am and
one at 5pm. We  didn’t do our homework properly and weren’t  quite aware of this
fact…</p>

<p>Eventually we made our  way into Port Townsend late in  the afternoon. We walked
from the bus stop to our accommodation. Everybody in town was very friendly, the
homeless people  sleeping in the  park were greeting us  as we walked  past. The
feel of the town was worlds apart from the busy city. Port Townsend truly is the
hidden gem of the pacific north west.  Our hosts drove us into town that evening
for dinner. It’s worth noting that we have never met them before. They were kind
enough  to put  us  up for  the  duration of  the festival  at  no charge.  It’s
important  to note  that  if  you’re planning  on  attending  the festival  that
accommodation books out a year in advance,  plan well ahead and book very early.
After dinner I had to  use a bit of slight of hand so  that I could actually pay
the bill, our hosts were being too kind to us. This was only the start of a very
warm reception in this wonderful town.</p>

<p>The next morning  our hosts sent me a  text message to inform me  that they have
left us passes  for the festival which will  get us in, free of  charge. This is
generally not  the sort of thing  we’re used to.  We stayed close enough  to the
festival grounds  so that we  could walk.  We set off  early in the  morning and
there was a  bit of a chill in the  air. By the time we reached  the festival it
was nice and warm.</p>

<p>The festival is held in the marina on the edge of town. There are over 300 boats
packed  in like  sardines. The  harbour master  did a  fantastic job.  The boats
ranged from large steamers and schooners  to small row boats, beautiful stand up
paddle boards  and kayaks. If  there was a  way to build it  out of wood  and it
floated you could find it there. This might sound strange but there were so many
beautiful boats  that it all got  lost in the  abundance. It was really  hard to
appreciate each  individual boat with so  many around it. The  docks were filled
with enthusiasts  of all  ages. It didn’t  take long before  we were  invited to
board vessels,  with proud owners showing  off their baby. We  could spend hours
talking to one owner  and looking at just one boat. Unfortunately  we only had 3
days to see as many of the 300 odd boats as we could.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/30818279046/in/dateposted-public/" title="DSC_6147"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5760/30818279046_c48db1aa02_c.jpg" width="800" height="531" alt="DSC_6147" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With so  many boats around,  and so many  Kiwi’s, there was  bound to be  a Kiwi
boat. Heather  is a 37 footer  built in Auckland  in 1937. She completed  a solo
circumnavigation in  the mid  60’s and  sailed to  Hawaii in  the 70’s,  now she
resides in Port Townsend. It was great to see a little bit of home.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/30222706544/in/photolist-N3FgHj-N3Fgi1-N3FfpC-N3FfSw-N3Fe8E-N3FdvC-NQfCUQ-NQfAT5-NQfAnL-NQfzPS-N3o7hP" title="DSC_6165"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5598/30222706544_dd4865ba9f_c.jpg" width="800" height="531" alt="DSC_6165" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Given  the amount  of boats  it became  quite  clear that  3 days  would not  be
enough, to  add to the  challenge there  were multiple seminars  being presented
simultaneously throughout the entire festival. It was impossible to choose which
seminars to attend and which to skip. They were all very well presented and full
of incredibly useful information. If you were  that way inclined you could get 3
days worth of value out of just  attending seminars. While all of this is taking
place there’s a bunch of teams building wooden boats for the competition that is
held over  the three days. We  were so busy that  we never got to  see the final
results. We  managed to have one  walk by to  inspect the progress on  the first
day. We spent some time in the  seminars, all the seminars we attended were well
presented and has something of value in them.</p>

<p>Our hosts put on a fantastic BBQ for  some of us Kiwis, we spent the whole night
having a great  time with all the new  friends we made. While at the  BBQ it was
suggested that we try to get onboard  for the schooner racing. We spent the next
morning trying to find  a boat to crew on. We were  not successful, barefoot Bob
to the rescue! We met Bob at the BBQ our hosts put on for the Kiwis, he’s a very
colourful character with  a great sense of  humour. Bob found us  a spot onboard
Sassafrass, the  owners were very friendly  and we had a  blast. There’s nothing
quite like experiencing these wonderful boats  out on the water under full sail!
This took up the entire afternoon, while  it cost us valuable time we could have
used looking at boats at the docks. This experience was well worth the cost!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/30553738340/in/dateposted-public/" title="DSC_6078"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5643/30553738340_42a4946780_c.jpg" width="800" height="263" alt="DSC_6078" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If that was not enough, the town  is littered with antique shops and second hand
bookshops. This  is another favourite of  ours, we only managed  2 bookshops and
one antique shop, it was huge, the biggest antique shop we’ve ever been in. This
alone made us wish we had 3 weeks to spend in this wonderful town.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/30553896060/in/album-72157674832493471/" title="DSC_6236"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5694/30553896060_5025e1b862_c.jpg" width="800" height="531" alt="DSC_6236" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>To top the experience off there were all  kinds of toys and eye candy for boats.
Almost anything  imaginable for wooden boats.  The foundry had a  display of the
wonderful goodies  they can  make for  your boat.  Authors selling  their books,
tools,  tools and  more  tools. If  you’re  a  lover of  wooden  boats, this  is
certainly the place to  be. I recommend you come for the  festival, but stay for
the town and it’s wonderful people!</p>

<p>The festival  closes with the  most spectacular event.  All the boats  leave the
marina and  sail up and  down the  harbour so that  everybody can see  them from
shore. I have never  in my life seen so many beautiful wooden  boats sail at the
same time. There were  classics as far as the eye could see.  To quote a friend,
“You can’t beat the classics!”</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/30219451333/in/dateposted-public/" title="DSC_6247"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5797/30219451333_f2200f7499_c.jpg" width="800" height="531" alt="DSC_6247" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that there’s only 2  buses in and out of Port Townsend. This
left us  with a  bit of  a dilemma.  Since I  didn’t do  my homework  and booked
flights out of SeaTac  for 9am on Monday, this meant we would  have to leave the
festival at 4pm on Sunday to catch the  bus at 5pm back to Seattle and spend the
night at the airport. When I started  to ask around if there was anybody leaving
super early on Monday  morning so we could catch the 6am  ferry (2 hours drive),
barefoot Bob came to our rescue. Bob is  a Port Townsend local, he’s got a heart
of gold. He  asked around, since he  was working with the harbour  master he was
talking to lots of  people. He came up empty handed, but  in the most unexpected
bit  of kindness  he offered  to drive  us  to the  ferry at  4am himself.  This
illustrates just how  kind the people in  this little town are. Bob  made an off
the cuff  comment that this  is what  they do in  Port Townsend. I  believe him,
everybody was awesome!</p>

<p>Suffice to  say we made the  journey on Monday  morning and caught our  plane to
Boston without any drama. A special  thanks to barefoot Bob, Brion and Christian
for making our  stay in Port Townsend very special  and something we’ll remember
for the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>If you ever  find yourself in Port  Townsend, find barefoot Bob!  Buy him lunch,
dinner or a beer. This will give you an excuse to meet him, he is awesome!</p>
