      <p>I’ve been warned about this before,  cruising with a schedule doesn’t work. This
is more  true if you’re  sailing engine  less. While it’s  true that we  have an
outboard, we don’t carry that much petrol and when there’s a reasonable chop the
motor is not much use.</p>

<p>We broke a  cardinal rule of cruising.  Whilst we’re both taking  a timeout from
work  at the  moment,  I’ve been  temporarily  sucked back  into  work for  some
important business deals to get closed out.</p>

<p>This unfortunate or  fortunate, depending on your perspective, fact  has lead to
us sailing back  to the marina in less than  favourable conditions. The schedule
dictated our  sailing day. Weather  plays an important  role in sailing  for us.
Since we’re still  learning we don’t like  to sail in conditions  that is beyond
our ability and comfort levels.</p>

<p>I was looking  at the forecasts for days.  There was either too much  wind or no
wind. When I finally saw a forecast that looked like we might be able to sail in
the morning and get close to the marina, we started to plan our journey.</p>

<p>It’s not a  huge journey, it’s only  28 nautical miles to reach  the marina. The
forecasts called for 1 to 7 knots in  the morning with the wind dying down after
10am. The winds were shifting between SW., E. and NE.</p>

<p>The plan was to get up early and sail for as long as we can. If we don’t make it
very far we can always anchor closer  and hopefully wait the weather out to make
it home on another day.</p>

<p>We woke up at  6am. and got Taleisin ready to sail.  We skipped breakfast opting
to eat while under way. We weighed anchor and started motoring out of the river.
It was nice and calm, compared to the  previous day. I looked at the clock as we
were motoring out, it was 7am.</p>

<p>Once we got out of the river I said  to Annie, lets get some sail up! We hoisted
the sails and the wind filled them. We  closed the throttle on the motor and put
it in neutral. That’s when the wind decided to die.</p>

<p>Some numbers…  We had less  than a full  tank of petrol.  When we left  on our
adventure we motored  for 16nm. and used  most of our petrol. With  no wind that
leaves us 12nm. short of the marina. If you’re running the numbers, this doesn’t
look favourable.</p>

<p>Plan A is to sail. Plan B is to motor to a closer anchorage and hopefully we can
then sail back to the marina before the heavy winds come up the next day. Plan A
does  seem to  be viable  at this  stage. So  we tried  an experiment,  open the
throttle just  a little get  Taleisin moving slowly. In  theory we should  get a
very long running time  on the petrol we have if we’re not  burning that much of
it along the way.</p>

<p>We managed to  get Taleisin moving at  2 knots with the  throttle slightly above
idle. We kept the sails up so that we could catch any puff of wind and hopefully
get a bit of a lift from that to move us along a little faster.</p>

<p>This worked well  for a few hours, we’d  be moving along at 2-3  knots, a little
puff would  come up and push  us along at 4  knots. We managed this  on the same
tack all  the way through the  Whangaparoa passage. When we  were almost through
the channel the wind  seemed to pick up. We turned the engine  off and sailed at
4.5 knots! Awesome,  it looks like we might  make it home at this  rate, sure it
would be slow and take most of the day. We had no other plans so we didn’t care.</p>

<p>Well, it  was nice while  it lasted. Five minutes  later the wind  dropped right
off. So we sat  bobbing around. It was a Saturday and  this meant that everybody
with a power boat  is out on the water, since it’s  perfect conditions for their
preferred type of boating. With power  boats zooming past us their wakes started
to make  it uncomfortable  onboard. We made  the call to  keep motoring  at slow
speed and hopefully we’ll catch a bit more wind.</p>

<p>Motoring was fine for  a little while with a direct line to  our way point. Then
the wind came  up again, but it  changed direction. We spent the  next few hours
trying to  motor slowly with winds  coming and going and  changing direction all
the time. We’re sailors, so we tack when we need to, no problem. We kept a close
eye on the amount of petrol we had left,  every half an hour we’d have a look at
petrol and  distance left. We found  some entertainment in listening  to the VHF
radio on  the coast guard channel.  You can learn  a lot by listening  to others
radio in their situation.  Once in a while they would  broadcast that Ovation of
the seas (a very large cruise ship) was anchored at some location that we didn’t
quite know.  The broadcast stated to  keep 60 meters  away from the ship  at all
times and to keep wakes at a  minimum. Slowly the situation started to turn more
favourable. So we decided to just go for it, and head for the marina!</p>

<p>When we  finally made it back  to the harbour we’ve  already had a long  day and
then we finally  got some wind. We had  enough wind so we could  turn the engine
off and reach all the way to the marina. We were also moving a lot faster.</p>

<p>This was all great  until we got to the Port of Auckland  docks. All of a sudden
the wind dropped  right down. This was likely  due to the fact that  there was a
huge cruise ship right in the middle of the harbour.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdki/32260586401/" title="Power boats"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/581/32260586401_35f461e942_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Power boats" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Usually it takes  about 30 minutes to get  back to the marina from  here. Let me
describe the scenario. It’s Saturday afternoon, it’s perfect power boat weather.
All of them are out on the water.  The location of the harbour we’re in has been
described as a washing machine to me  in the past. There’s power boats, ferries,
ship’s tenders zipping back and forth. Combined with the huge ship in the middle
of the harbour. This is chaos. We have no wind to sail with, which we need since
the motor is no use because of the chop. Basically we’re in the most challenging
situation we’ve been in to date. The right thing to do would have been to anchor
somewhere  and wait  for more  favourable conditions.  Cruising with  a schedule
doesn’t work.</p>

<p>We still have our  sails set, since we need to sail in  this spot. We still have
the motor going since we have no wind  and we can’t be floating around this area
as it’s  busy. Annie’s  sitting by the  outboard throttle to  close it  when the
motor lifts out  of the water. I’m trying  to keep the boat on  course and avoid
collision since power boat skippers for some reason like to pass really close by
and they  seem to  like crossing  in front of  us. Given  that we’re  not really
sailing we don’t have right of way  since we’re technically a power boat at this
point.</p>

<p>We’re moving very slowly, we’re trying to figure out the best course to steer to
get out  of this  mess as  quickly as possible.  Given the  huge ship  the winds
became very  fluky. Without any warning  we’d suddenly have our  head sails back
winded and our bow pushed over. Given the tendency of power boats to pass really
close to  us, this became a  very challenging situation  as the wind can  put us
into a  possible collision at any  moment. That means  we have to tack  and also
keep the motor under  control. Since the winds are light we  had both head sails
up, this meant we had quite a few things to deal with and quickly. As soon as we
finished the operation the wind would shift  and we’d do it all over again. This
process was repeated relentlessly. We were  tacking back and forth, motoring for
a few second and sailing for a few seconds. Then another boat would come by. The
wakes would rock  the boat back and  forth and bounce up and  down. Tack, motor,
dodge a boat. Tack, motor, doge, repeat. It seemed like it was never ending.</p>

<p>It took us  2 hours to get through  this little section of the  harbour. We were
absolutely exhausted by it, after we’ve already been out in the sun all day.</p>

<p>When we finally got  past the cruise ship the wind picked  up, the direction was
stable and  we sailed right to  the marina entrance.  I dropped the jib  and the
main. Annie steered  us into the marina  while still under stays’l.  Once we got
into flat clam water and the motor was working properly, I dropped the stays’l.</p>

<p>At this point I took over the helm from  Annie and we slowly made our way to our
slip. Slow and  easy. I managed to  put Taleisin into the slip  with an absolute
perfect landing. Annie grabbed the mooring  lines and secured Taleisin. I looked
at the clock  and it was 5pm. It  felt great to do this with  precision! I just
wish the  usual spectators were  there to witness it.  It would seem  people are
only ever watching when I make a mess of things.</p>

<p>It was a nice calm day. We had the most challenging day of sailing to date. This
turned out to  be a big adventure, even  though it was only a  short distance to
cover. We were absolutely exhausted! We both slept very well that night!</p>

<p>The moral of the story here is not  to have more petrol, but you can be forgiven
for thinking that. The  real moral of the story here is that  you cannot allow a
schedule to  dictate your cruising. Sure,  if we had  a boat with an  inboard we
could have motored all the way back at  7 knots and made the journey in 4 hours.
It would have been uneventful and no  big deal. Instead we got a huge adventure,
we got challenged.  We managed to get  through the challenge and  it felt great.
Because of the choices we make, it’s possible to have adventures all the time or
none of the  time. Things that make  certain tasks easier also takes  a lot away
from it. We could choose the easy way or we could choose adventure…</p>

<p>As a final comment,  there was only one power boat that was  truly a pain in the
rear, the big  one disrupting the winds.  The other ones are just  part of life.
Regardless it still contributed a lot to this adventure. For those wondering we
still had about 3.5 litres of petrol left.</p>
