Our  recent status  as  wooden boat  owners  has  opened up  many  new doors  to
interested and exciting  opportunities. We are not only new  to wooden boats but
to boats and sailing itself. One evening after completing one of many boat tasks
I gave  Lin Pardey a call  to share my  experiences. Lin suggested that  we come
along to the wooden boat festival. This presented numerous challenges concerning
work for both Annie and myself. When I  got home that evening I told Annie about
this random spur of the moment idea and we decided that life is too short, screw
it - lets do it!

I distinctly remember Annie asking, "What will I be doing for three whole days"?

Fast forward to September 6 2016, we're  on our way to Seattle, Washington. This
is one of  the routes into Port Townsend.  In order to get to  Port Townsend you
really want to  have to get there.  Driving from Seattle takes  2 hours, getting
there by public  transport is quite a  feat in itself. Our  journey from Seattle
started early in the morning taking the train from our hotel close to the SeaTac
airport. A short walk from down town Seattle to a 30 minute ferry ride. Once off
the Ferry we  caught a bus to Poulsbo,  we spent the bulk of the  day in Poulsbo
waiting for  one of  2 buses to  Port Townsend, one  at 9am  and one at  5pm. We
didn't do our homework properly and wasn't quite aware of this fact...

Eventually we made our  way into Port Townsend late in  the afternoon. We walked
from the bus stop to our accommodation. Everybody in town was very friendly, the
homeless people sleeping in the park was greeting us as we walked past. The feel
of the  town was worlds  apart from  the busy city.  Port Townsend truly  is the
hidden gem of the pacific north west.  Our hosts drove us into town that evening
for dinner, it's worth noting that we have never met them before, they were kind
enough  to put  us  up for  the  duration of  the festival  at  no charge.  It's
important  to note  that  if  you're planning  on  attending  the festival  that
accommodations books out a year in advance, plan well ahead and book very early.
After dinner I had to use a bit of slight of hand so that *I* could actually pay
the bill, our hosts were being too kind to us. This was only the start of a very
warm reception in this wonderful town.

The next morning  our hosts sent me a  text message to inform me  that they have
left us passes  for the festival which will  get us in, free of  charge. This is
generally not  the sort of thing  we're used to.  We stayed close enough  to the
festival grounds  so that we  could walk.  We set off  early in the  morning and
there was a  bit of a chill in the  air. By the time we reached  the festival it
was nice and warm.

The festival is held  in the marina on the edge of town.  There's over 300 boats
packed  in like  sardines. The  harbour master  did a  fantastic job.  The boats
ranged from large steamers and schooners to  small row boats. If there was a way
to build it out of wood and it  floated you could find it there, beautiful stand
up paddle  boards and kayaks.  This might sound strange  but there were  so many
beautiful boats  that it all got  lost in the  abundance. It was really  hard to
appreciate each  individual boat with so  many around it. The  docks were filled
with enthusiasts  of all  ages. It didn't  take long before  we were  invited to
board vessels,  with proud owners showing  off their baby. We  could spend hours
talking to one owner  and looking at just one boat. Unfortunately  we only had 3
days to see as many of the 300 odd boats as we could.

Given  the amount  of boats  it became  quite  clear that  3 days  would not  be
enough, to  add to  the challenge  there was  multiple seminars  being presented
simultaneously throughout the entire festival. It was impossible to choose which
seminars to attend and which to skip. They were all very well presented and full
of incredibly useful information. If you were  that way inclined you could get 3
days worth of value out of just  attending seminars. While all of this is taking
place there's a bunch of teams building wooden boats for the competition that is
held over  the three days. We  were so busy that  we never got to  see the final
results, we  managed to have one  walk by to  inspect the progress on  the first
day. We spent some  time in the seminars, all the seminars  we attended was well
presented and  has something of  value in  them.

Our hosts put on a fantastic BBQ for  some of us Kiwis, we spent the whole night
having a great  time with all the new  friends we made. While at the  BBQ it was
suggested that we try to get onboard  for the schooner racing. We spent the next
morning trying to find  a boat to crew on. We were  not successful, barefoot Bob
to the  rescue! Bob  found us a  spot onboard Sassafrass,  the owners  were very
friendly  and we  had a  blast. There's  nothing quite  like experiencing  these
wonderful  boats out  on the  water under  full sail!  This took  up the  entire
afternoon, while it cost us valuable time we could have used looking at boats at
the docks. This experience was well worth the cost!

If that was not enough, the town  is littered with antique shops and second hand
bookshops. This  is another favourite of  ours, we only managed  2 bookshops and
one antique shop, it was huge, the biggest antique shop we've ever been in. This
alone made us wish we had 3 weeks to spend in this wonderful town.

To top the experience  off there was all kinds of toys and  eye candy for boats.
Almost anything  imaginable for wooden boats.  The foundry had a  display of the
wonderful goodies  they can  make for  your boat.  Authors selling  their books,
tools,  tools and  more  tools. If  you're  a  lover of  wooden  boats, this  is
certainly the place to  be. I recommend you come for the  festival, but stay for
the town and it's wonderful people!

The festival  closes with the  most spectacular event.  All the boats  leave the
marina and sail  around the harbour up  and down so that everybody  can see them
from shore. I have never in my life  seen so many beautiful wooden boats sail at
the same  time. There  were classics as  far as  the eye could  see. To  quote a
friend, "You can't beat the classics!"

I mentioned earlier that there's only 2  buses in and out of Port Townsend. This
left us  with a  bit of  a dilemma.  Since I  didn't do  my homework  and booked
flights out of SeaTac  for 9am on Monday, this meant we would  have to leave the
festival at 4pm on Sunday to catch the  bus at 5pm back to Seattle and spend the
night at the airport. When I started  to ask around if there was anybody leaving
super early on Monday  morning so we could catch the 6am  ferry (2 hours drive),
barefoot Bob came to our rescue. Bob is  a Port Townsend local, he's got a heart
of gold. Bob asked  around, since he was working with the  harbour master he was
talking to lots of people. Bob came  up empty handed, but in the most unexpected
bit  of kindness  he offered  to drive  us  to the  ferry at  4am himself.  This
illustrates just how kind the people in this little town is. Bob made an off the
cuff  comment that  this  is what  they  do  in Port  Townsend.  I believe  him,
everybody was awesome!

Suffice to  say we made the  journey on Monday  morning and caught our  plane to
Boston without any drama. A special  thanks to barefoot Bob, Brian and Christian
for making our  stay in Port Townsend very special  and something we'll remember
for the rest of our lives.
